## Situation
Litware has offices in Boston and Seattle. Litware also has remote users located across the United States. To access Litware resources, including cloud resources, the remote users establish a VPN connection to either office.
## Current Problems   
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps frequently generates false positive alerts when users connect to both offices simultaneously.  
  
## Business Requirements
Litware identifies the following business requirements:  
  
• The principle of least privilege must be used whenever possible.  
• Costs must be minimized, as long as all other requirements are met.  
• Logs collected by Log Analytics must provide a full audit trail of user activities.  
• All domain controllers must be protected by using Microsoft Defender for Identity.  
  
**Azure Information Protection Requirements**  
  
All files that have sensitivity labels and are stored on the Windows 10 computers must be available from the Azure Information Protection – Data discovery dashboard.  
  
**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Requirements**  
  
All Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps unsanctioned apps must be blocked on the Windows 10 computers by using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  
  
**Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Security Requirements**  
  
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps must identify whether a user connection is anomalous based on tenant-level data.  
  
**Microsoft Defender for Cloud Requirements**  
  
All servers must send logs to the same Log Analytics workspace.  
  
**Microsoft Sentinel Requirements**  
  
Litware must meet the following Microsoft Sentinel requirements:  
  
• Integrate Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.  
• Ensure that a user named admin1 can configure Microsoft Sentinel playbooks.  
• Create a Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule based on a custom query. The rule must automatically initiate the execution of a playbook.  
• Add notes to events that represent data access from a specific IP address to provide the ability to reference the IP address when navigating through an investigation graph while hunting.  
• Create a test rule that generates alerts when inbound access to Microsoft Office 365 by the Azure AD test user accounts is detected. Alerts generated by the rule must be grouped into individual incidents, with one incident per test user account.  

You need to configure DC1 to meet the business requirements.
